# Incident Report: Debian GUI Authentication Failure

**Date:** 2025-12-11  
**System:** Debian Linux (GNOME Desktop)  
**Status:** Resolved  
**Severity:** High (System Inaccessible via GUI)

## 1. Issue Description
**Issue:** User unable to authenticate into the Debian Graphical User Interface (GUI). The system refuses further input in the login field, with the only available option being to reboot.  
**Context:** The issue emerged following recent network configuration changes (new modem provided by my ISP) and heavy usage of XRDP (Remote Desktop Protocol).  
**Error Behavior:** "Authentication Error" displayed, followed by a UI freeze preventing further input. No security lockout mechanisms were triggered.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis
**Diagnosis:** **Session Conflict & Permission Lock** The XRDP service generated conflicting configuration files within the user's home directory. Specifically:
* **Configuration Conflict:** A `.xsession` file was created, forcing the GDM to attempt loading a remote session configuration on the local physical display.
* **Permission Lock:** Root-owned `.Xauthority` lock files were present in the user's home directory, preventing the local user from writing new session cookies.

## 3. Remediation Steps

### Phase 1: Isolation
* **Action:** Bypassed the frozen GUI by switching to a TTY terminal session (`Ctrl`+`Alt`+`F3`).
* **Result:** Successful login via TTY confirmed that user credentials were valid and the account was not locked by security policies.

### Phase 2: Permission Restoration
* **Action:** Executed ownership repair on the home directory to revert any root-owned files created by the remote session.
    ```bash
    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER $HOME
    ```

### Phase 3: Artifact Removal
* **Action:** Removed unused session lock files preventing new GUI logins.
    ```bash
    rm $HOME/.Xauthority
    rm $HOME/.ICEauthority
    ```

### Phase 4: Configuration Reset
* **Action:** Removed XRDP-generated startup files. These were identified as the primary culprits causing the display manager crash.
    ```bash
    rm $HOME/.xsession
    rm $HOME/.xinitrc
    ```

### Phase 5: Environment Repair
* **Action:** Cleared session cache and verified binary integrity of the display manager.
    ```bash
    mv $HOME/.config $HOME/.config_backup
    rm -rf $HOME/.cache/sessions
    sudo apt-get install --reinstall gnome-session gdm3
    ```

## 4. Conclusion
The system was fully recovered without a re-installation. The conflict was isolated to user-level configuration files generated by the remote desktop service.
